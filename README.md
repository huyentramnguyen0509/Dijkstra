## Acknowledgement
We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to our teacher throughout the past semester, particularly in this course. The support and dedication you have shown are undeniable. We truly appreciate all the efforts you have put into helping us, especially during 
challenging times.

This course has been truly challenging, but the exposure to its content has been greatly beneficial for us. Similarly, the project was not without its difficulties, but with collaborative spirit and your guidance, we managed to overcome all obstacles.

We would like to extend our sincere thanks to the instructors at the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City for their support during our research. Special appreciation goes to our seniors at the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City for sharing insights and
skills that enabled us to complete this project.
